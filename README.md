Real World Application of Data Analytics

This project looks at the Eviction data in NYC across the 5 boroughs. The NYC Open data website provides public data evictions carried out from 2017 until 2020. This dataset includes information regarding the date, address, zipcode, etc. of the eviction performed.

The purpose of this project is to look closely at Manhattan District 9 where evictions have occurred. We want to know the characteristics of the dataset, sliced and analyzed by different categories and across different periods of time. 

This will be an overall exploratory data analysis to help identify key patterns in the specified areas.
